## Upcoming events

## Q's of the week
- Are history and geography destiny?
- How has LATAM been shaped by its history?

## Standard "story"
1. People lived in the Americas before Columbus in 1492
2. Europeans "conquered" the Americas
3. Colonial institutions were established to extract natural resources and labor from the hemisphere
4. The colonies rebelled and independence was establish
5. LATAM states failed to consolidate post-Independence
6. The perverse legacies of the past are a drag on modernization

## Early settlement
- "Neolithic Revolution": agriculture and sedentary societies
	- Laid the foundations for more complex forms of social organization
- By the time of the conquest, large empires had already risen and fallen
	- Tiwanaku, Olmec, Teotihuacan, Mayans

## Political Economy Before Colonization
- Numerous complex, hierarchical societies with political, economic, and religious institutions
	- eg. Triple Alliance / Aztec Empire
- Political divisions, cleavages, and conflict

## New and Old Institutions
- Conquest was facilitated by the structure of the empire
	- Once center fell the dependent city states quickly recognized Spanish rule
- Conquistadores usurped the pre-existing Aztec tribute system, supplanting the leaders at the top.

## Conquest Beyond the Triple Alliance
- The process of the Conquest did not play out the same everywhere
	- Different patterns of alliances and enemies
	- Different paths of political development in areas of population scarcity
- Other examples from the continent
	- Conquest of the Inca empire - civil war
	- Conquest of Yucat'an peninsula - disease

## Varieties of Colonial Rule
- Political and economic institutions differed across space
	- Different dependence on settlement
	- Institutions in center vs. periphery
- The Church and Crown had a complex relationship to indigenous subjects
	- Dependent on tribute from population, role of religion
	- Created institutions to protect as well as to exploit commoners, often at expense of local elites.

## Role of Epidemic Disease
- Within a century of the Conquest, the indigenous population of the Americas had declined dramatically.
- Famine, warfare, coercion played a role, but the major culprit was disease
	- Smallpox and other European diseases
	- Indigenous diseases exacerbated by poor living conditions
- This forced a reorganization of land and labor institutions

## Brazil
- Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) divided South America into Spanish and Portuguese lands
- No large populations or mineral wealth to exploit
	- Extraction through sugar economy, cattle ranching
	- Economy designed for export
	- Colonization effort, slavery
- More lax royal control than in New Spain
