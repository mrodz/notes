## This week in LATAM
- Guyana's presidential election: Sep 1
	- Political contestation; oil boom

- US Warships off Venezuelan coast
	- Saber-rattling, anti-drug trafficking, something bigger?
- Bolsonaro's trial in Brazil begins today
	- Five charges related including attempted coup, interruption of democratic rule of law.

## Q's for the First Module
- What makes LATAM "Latin America"?
- How has Latin America been shaped by its history and geography
- What are the mechanisms through which historical events and institutions continue to shape economic and public life
- Are history and geography destiny? Can historical trajectories be changed by politics, economics, or policy?

## Why define "Latin America"?
- What makes LATAM distinctive (or not)?
- Do the theories and ideas that we are discussing only apply to Latin America, or can they tell us something about the world in general?
- If these theories apply elsewhere, what is gained or lost when we choose to focus on Latin America?
- What do/don't Latin American countries have in common?

## The Americas, America, Am'erica, Am'erique
- Refers to the continents of North and South America
	- Usually includes Caribbean islands
	- Most of the western hemisphere
- Sometimes referred to as the New World

## Latin America: A Term with "Racist" Origins
- French intellectuals (notably Michel Chevalier) differentiated the _race latine_ from the Teutonic, Anglo-Saxon, or Slavic races
	- Idea that there was a cultural and linguistic tie between those speaking Romance languages
	- Used to justify French imperialism in Mexico, among other things.
- Spanish and Latin American thinkers also drew a distinction
	- Colombian poet Jos'e Mar'ia Torres Caicedo discussed the "two americas": the "Peoples of the South" and the "Americas of the North"
	- Sim'on Bol'ivar, Andr'es Bello, and others used these pan-american labels

## Contemporary Definitions
- _Latin American Politics and Societies_: countries of the Americas where Spanish or Portuguese is the main language spoken
- World Bank and UNDP use "Latin America and the Caribbean": all independent nations of the western hemisphere that are not the U.S. or Canada

## Colonial Origins
- Spanish or Portuguese colonial heritage (as opposed to British)
	- Excludes Belize, Jamaica, Barbados, and other Caribbean nations with British colonial heritage
	- Status of Haiti and other French colonies left ambiguous
- Note that colonial boundaries do not always map to contemporary borders

## Time of Independence
- Most LATAM countries won independence from European countries in the 1820's. 
	- Distinctive from Africa and South/Southeast Asia
- Exceptions: Panama, Cuba, DR, Brazil
- Puerto Rico: considered part of Latin America in the 19th century, but not since annexation

## Catholic Church
 - Distinctive feature of "LATAM" vs. British Colonies
	 - Connection to colonization
	 - Many countries remained explicitly Catholic post-independence
- But anti-clericalism contributes to major political conflicts
	- Mexico, Cuba, Argentina, Colombia
- Catholic faith is in decline
	- Increased influence/presence of Protestant religions and secularism.

## Indigeneity/Mestizaje
- Latin American societies are a distinctive mix of Indigenous and European cultures
	- Assimilation and adaptation of different peoples
- But density of Indigenous cultures and intensity of migration varies greatly
	- Mexico or Guatemala vs. Chile or Argentina
	- Overlooks importances of Afro-descendant and Asian-descendant people
- The same can be said of many non-Latin American places
	- USA, Canada

## Political Institutions
- Most (all?) Latin American countries have civil law (as opposed to common law) systems
	- Distinguishes it from British holdings
	- But most of the world also uses civil law
- Most (all?) Latin American countries have a presidential (as opposed to parliamentary) system of government
	- Unique combination of presidentialism with PR

## Economic Conditions
- Historically thought of as agrarian, dependent on natural resources
	- "Banana Republic" stereotype
	- But: region is predominantly urban today
- Countries are "late developers"
	- Most are middle income
	- Huge variation within region (and within countries)
	- Changes in the economic winners and losers over time

## Our working definition
- We will employ a fairly expansive version of Latin America
	- Independent countries descended from Spanish and Portuguese colonial holdings in the mainland, plus independent Caribbean nations, continued colonial holdings where Spanish or Portuguese are the primary spoken languages.

## LATAM is neither the richest nor the poorest region of the world
- Most countries considered "middle income" but wide disparity
	- Highest GPD/capita: Panama, Chile, Uruguay, Argentina, Mexico ($20-25,000 US in PPP)
	- Lowest: Haiti ($1800), Honduras ($5,600), ...
- Latin America has grown rapidly
	- Rapid urbanization
	- Sharp declines in infant mortality, illiteracy
	- Increase in life expectancy, education levels, infrastructure access

## Inequality
- Latin America is one of the most unequal regions of the world by most measures
	- Income equality
	- Access to health, education, infrastructure
	- Political voice
- Evidence that improvement has leveled off
	- Steady decline in inequality from 1990-2014
	- Stagnation/depreciation since
	- Government policy plays an important role
- Economic Policies
	- Historical dependence on natural resource exports
	- Many Latin American countries followed similar shifts in economic policy over the last 60 years
		- Era of important-substitution
		- Neoliberal reforms, "shock-therapy," and economic openness
		- Structural changes from agrarian/commodity based economies to industrial and increasingly service-based economies

## Political evolution
- Early 20th century/Cold War era
	- Proxy/Guerilla Wars
	- Coup Trap
	- Military Dictatorships
	- Authoritarianism
- "Third Wave" of democratization since 1975
	- Nearly all LatAm countries now have regular elections
	- Coups are now vanishingly rare
- Challenges persist
	- Populism
	- Evidence of democratic backsliding

## War and Peace in Latin America
- Many conflicts over the 20th century, few outright wars today
	- End of Cold War
	- Colombian peace process
	- Mexican drug war
- Current challenge: Epidemic of Homicide
	- Highest regional homicide rate in the world by some definitions
		- Legacies of war?
		- Drugs/Arms trade?
