During the mid-20th century, the global steel industry expanded rapidly, with significant investments in new plants and technologies. By the 1970s and 1980s, however, this expansion led to overcapacity because the supply of steel exceeded demand. In the United States, this led to falling steel prices, reduced profitability, and widespread layoffs. Many steel plants were forced to close, and the industry went through significant consolidation. Japan, on the other hand, benefited from an early emphasis on controlled supply, new techniques to improve operating efficiency, and the formation of keiretsu—networks of interlinked corporations that facilitated sharing and collaborative growth. This allowed Japan’s steel industry to be globally competitive, growing at 6 percent CAGR from 1960 to 2000 versus less than 1 percent for the United States.
