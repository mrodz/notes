> Out of 20 primary media arenas we analyzed that are vying for consumers’ attention, the value of an hour of consumption ranged from highs of $33 per hour for live sports, $24 per hour for amusement parks, and $17 per hour for live concerts to lows of $0.12 per hour for digital music, $0.11 per hour for radio, and $0.05 per hour for podcasts (Exhibit 2)

> The attention quotient consists of two primary components: consumers’ level of focus, or how actively engaged they are with the content, and the job to be done, or why they are consuming the content. Taken together, these components have significant predictive power on total monetization, including advertising and nonadvertising

> Gen Z consumers and baby boomers report the same level of average focus, but it’s split across different mediums: Gen Z consumers are highly focused when playing video games, using the same level of focus boomers exert while reading a newspaper. The greatest disparity comes in attending live sports, with boomers being far more focused than Gen Zers (though Gen Z reports modestly more focus when watching live sports on television).

> Across consumers, a 10 percent increase in average focus paid across mediums is associated with a 17 percent increase in spend across mediums. Consumers in the top quartile of focus spend twice as much as those in the bottom quartile

> For instance, an equation estimate of monetization that’s higher than its actual value (for streaming video, for example) may imply that the medium is undermonetized and that revenue can or will accelerate with respect to consumption

> Our research suggests that the top 10 percent of spenders (by dollars spent) make up almost 50 percent of consumer spend in media.

> The concentration of spend among heavy consumers of media (by time spent) is less stark: the top 10 percent of consumers of media only make up about 20 percent of spend. These super users aren’t necessarily “super spenders.”

>  Attention correlates with the nominal number—not the concentration—of high-demand titles a service carries, as measured by the Parrot Analytics Demand Score.10 Streaming platforms that host more titles in the 75th, 90th, and 99th percentiles capture higher-quality attention, even if those hits make up a smaller share of the total catalog.

> Sports and news are the only genres whose primary job to be done isn’t light entertainment: for sports, it’s “to enjoy something that I love,” and for news, it’s “to receive education and information.” Up to twice as many viewers are most focused when consuming sports and news than any other genre.

> The attention equation helps clarify what the winners in that competition have intuited: Quality and relevance, not just quantity, of attention goes a long way in determining success. In a media environment defined by abundance, fragmentation, and distraction, valuable attention—driven by focus and intent— is the objective function.
