## "Our financial goals:"
### 1️⃣ Sustain healthy revenue growth 
### 2️⃣ Expand our operating margin
### 3️⃣ Grow free cash flow.

## ❌ NO ADDITIONAL TIERS OF CONTENT 
### Why not add additional tiers of content (i.e. premium content for more $ per month)?

We have plans based on concurrent streams, picture quality, and other features, and in some markets, ad-supported and mobile-only plans. We don't think tiers of content would be the best way to grow the business at this time. See our Plans and Pricing [page](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/24926) for further details on our current offering.

## Netflix uses "Standard Forward Contracts" for FX
> In terms of our approach, we’re using standard forward contracts with the goal of reducing volatility in our operating profit. We won’t hedge all of our currencies and are focusing on the currencies where we have the largest exposure and greatest risk/volatility, among other factors. Therefore, we’ll still have exposure to foreign currency movements, but to a lesser extent than without hedges.

##  ✅ "We’ll tend to outperform our near term operating margin targets on dollar weakness and underperform on dollar strength."

## ✅ REVENUE >>> MEMBERSHIP GROWTH

We seek to grow revenue because it allows us to invest in more and better content and to improve our service and deliver profits for our shareholders.
### Bundles
> In cases where the price that the member pays for the service is established by the partners and there is no standalone price for the Netflix service (for instance, in a bundle), these payments are recognized as a reduction of revenues.
## What makes a show successful?
> We measure the impact of our originals on our ability to acquire new members and engagement, which is correlated with retention of existing members. We also seek reasonable economics relative to other exclusive content on a cost per hour viewed. We also take into account critical acclaim and awards for our originals and the impact original series may have on enhancing our brand and attractiveness of our service which helps with member growth.

## ✅ Increase in Original Series
> Given the success we've had with our original series and films, we have increased our investment in this area over time and originals represent the majority of our content spend. We will also continue to license titles to complement our original programming and invest in newer content areas, such as gaming. Over the long term, we expect our total content investment to increase.

## ✅ Over 70% of our members are now outside the US
> ... and we offer more and more great, authentic, local stories to further satisfy them and grow engagement in these regions.
> It is well known that Hollywood content travels very well abroad, but we also see that our biggest local language titles also find audiences in many other countries, including the US, and can go global.

- Money Heist (Spain 🇪🇸)
- Lupin (France 🇫🇷)

## Netflix is optimistic about their Games
> We believe we can build games as a strong content category, leveraging our film and series, by connecting our members, especially fans of specific IP, effectively with games that they will love. 

## Free Cash Flow and P/L Discrepancies
Cash payments for licensed originals are weighted more upfront (relative to P&L) and for content that we produce, we fund the production cost during the content creation process prior to the completion and release of the title, when amortization begins. These timing differences can result in content cash payments being higher or lower than content amortization on our P&L in a given quarter or year.


## We fund our investments through operating profits and, historically, by raising debt.
> As opposed to external financing

## Additionally, we have a $3B revolving credit facility and we expect to refinance upcoming debt maturities. We don’t currently have plans to increase leverage to buy back stock or issue a dividend, as we value balance sheet flexibility.
> a flexible, pre-approved loan from a financial institution that allows a borrower to repeatedly draw, repay, and re-borrow funds up to a specified credit limit.

## COMPETITORS
This includes watching content on other streaming services, linear TV, or series/film rentals or purchases but also reading a book, surfing YouTube, playing video games, social media, messaging apps, going out to dinner with friends or enjoying a glass of wine with their partner, just to name a few. We earn a tiny fraction of consumers’ time and money, and have lots of opportunities to win more share of leisure time, if we can keep improving.
### We strive to win more of our members' "moments of truth". 
Those decision points are, say, at 7:15 pm when a member wants to relax, enjoy a shared experience with friends and family, or is bored. The member could choose Netflix, or a multitude of other options.
**Great inexpensive services like Netflix will hopefully help insulate video from piracy.**

## International Commentary
We understand that awareness of Netflix in these new markets is mixed and that there are cultural differences and some variances in content tastes around the world. There are also challenges with the broadband and payment infrastructures in certain countries.

That’s why we are increasingly licensing and producing content all across the globe and Netflix members everywhere in the world can increasingly enjoy the same movies and TV series at the same time, free of legacy business models and outdated restrictions. In addition, we are developing a growing number of non-English language originals from places such as Mexico, France, Italy, Japan and Brazil, to name just a few. With our global distribution, Netflix is well positioned to bring engaging stories from many cultures to people all across the globe.
