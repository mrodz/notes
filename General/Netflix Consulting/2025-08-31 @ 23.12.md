Netflix faces a ton of pressure competing in India because of Disney+ Hotstar's firm grasp on Indian localized content.
> Indian consumers also have a relatively low willingness to pay for streaming platforms thanks to free, ad-supported models from local content providers and rampant piracy.
> Recently, two of Netflix's competitors scaled back on ambitions there. Disney ([DIS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DIS)) said in February that it would effectively give up its ownership of the network Star India by merging it with Indian telecom giantÂ [Reliance Industries](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RELIANCE.NS?.tsrc=fin-srch). It will hold a minority stake in the entity.
> Two weeks later, Paramount Global ([PARA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PARA?.tsrc=fin-srch))Â [said it was selling its 13% stake](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/paramount-sells-viacom18-stake-reliance-161616691.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall)Â in Indian media company Viacom18 to Reliance for about $517 million
