## Review
- When price goes up, supply goes up (i.e. supply curve slopes upwards)
	- At low $P$, low and high $OC$ units are produced.
- Perfectly competitive market conditions (esp. many buyers and sellers)
- Diminishing returns in production: unit $n+1$ costs more to produce than unit $n$.
- Equilibrium: a state where no force is working to change $P$ and $Q$: if the price is:
	- Higher than $P^*$, there will be excess supply which will push price down
	- Lower than $P^*$, there will be excess demand which will push price down

## Equilibrium
### How does equilibrium happen?
- Suppose price $p$ is a bargain, so that $D(p) > S(p)$.
	- We'll have a shortage aka excess demand
	- Shortages cause prices to rise
	- Prices rising $\to$ Demand decrease, Supply increase
	- So the difference between $D(p)$ and $S(p)$ shrinks.
- This will continue until we arrive at a price $p^*$ such that $D(p^*) = S(p^*)$.

### The Algebra of Equilibrium
- Assume that Demand: $$Q^D=Y-P$$
- At $Q_D=0, P=Y$
- Assume that Supply: $$Q^S=T+P$$
- $T$ is something that shifts supply, like technology

Given $D$ and $S$ curves, can we solve for $P$ and $Q$?

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
Q^D&=Y-P\\
Q^S&=T+P\\
\text{ Yes! Because }& \text{in equilibrium,}  \\
Q^S&=Q^D
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$
#### So, equilibrium price:
$$
P^*=\frac{Y-T}{2}
$$
#### And, equilibrium demand:
$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
Q^D&=\frac{2Y}{2}-\frac{Y-T}{2}\\
Q^*&=\frac{Y+T}{2}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$
