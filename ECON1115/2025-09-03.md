## Recap
1. Law of Demand
2. Link between Demand Curve and Marginal Willingness to Pay
	1. Marginal is key
3. Distinguishing between
	1. Movements along a Demand Curve
	2. Shift in the Demand Curve
4. Why do Shifts in Demand happen?
	1. Changes in income: normal/inferior goods
	2. $\Delta$ in other prices

## Combining Individual Demand Curves
- The market Q demanded at each price is the sum of the individual quantities demanded at each price.
- Graphically, the market demand curve is found by summing __horizontally__ the individual demand curves

## What does the Demand Curve Tell Us?
- Suppose we know the Demand Curve, can we predict P and Q?
	- Demand curve alone CANNOT determine both P and Q

## Supply
- Sellers (often "firms") want to earn a living or turn profit by selling their goods and services
- The supply curve asks "how much is supplied at each price"
- A perfectly competitive market is one in which
	- there are many buyers and sellers
	- all goods are identical
	- all market participants have the same information
- This implies: sellers must take the price as outside of their control
- Supply Curves gives how much will be produced at each Price in a Perfectly Competitive Market
- The supply curve slopes __up__.
	- When the price of a good increases, more firms will enter the market, produce and supply. Also, existing firms already in the market might produce more
- Why does the supply curve slope up
	- All production has opportunity costs
	- Producers will only produce if gain is greater than opportunity cost
	- Now note that some producers have higher opportunity costs than others


| Quantity Produced | Hours of Labor Needed | Cost of Labor ($20/hr) | Marginal Opportunity Cost |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1                 | 2                     | 40                     | 40                        |
| 2                 | 5                     | 100                    | 60                        |
| 3                 | 9                     | 180                    | 80                        |
| 4                 | 14                    | 280                    | 100                       |
- This is called Diminishing Returns
	- 2nd costs more than the 1st to produce
	- 3rd costs more than the 2nd to produce
	- etc.
- Let's assume Diminishing Returns always applies

At low price, only low marginal opportunity cost units are produced
At high price, low AND high opportunity costs are produced

Concept of ceteris paribus allows us to distinguish between
1. A movement along the supply curve
2. A shift in the supply curve

Always be careful to distinguish between
- A shift in DEMAND vs Change in Quantity Demanded
- A shift in SUPPLY vs Change in Supply Demanded

## Equilibrium
- Defined as a state where no force is working to change $P$ and $Q$.
