## Equilibrium
- We saw what happens when prices cannot adjust (perhaps due to a price ceiling)
- We also saw what happens when prices have a floor.
- Just as in a graph, we find equilibrium as the point where $Q^D=Q^S$, in algebra we find equilibrium by setting $Q^D=Q^S$.
- Steepness matters for equilibrium outcomes
- Slopes are not unit free:
	- Slope of demand curve for gasoline depends on gallos, liters, barrels, etc.

## Price Elasticity of Demand and Supply
- The **Elasticity of Demand with respect to Price** is the % change in quantity demanded associated with a given % change in price. $$\frac{\%\Delta Q^D}{\%\Delta P}=\frac{-12.5\%}{+25\%}=-0.5$$
- The **Elasticity of Supply with respect to price** is the % change in quantity supplied associated with a given % change in price. $$\frac{\%\Delta Q^S}{\%\Delta P}$$
- Alternate (usual) formula for Elasticity $$\frac{\%\Delta{Q}}{\%\Delta{P}}=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P}\times\frac{P_\text{old}}{Q_\text{old}}$$
- Calculate some elasticities:

### Definitions
1. When abs(Elasticity) < 1, "inelastic"
2. When abs(Elasticity) > 1, "elastic"
3. When abs(Elasticity) = 1, "unit elastic"

Some inelastic curves are more inelastic than others. The top one, for instance, does not really change quantity demanded with a change in price. 

Very inelastic demand: Examples can be gasoline, prescription meds, etc.
Very elastic demand: Examples can be a restaurant's prices

## Cross Price Elasticity of Demand
$$
\frac{\%\Delta Q_1^D}{\%\Delta P_2}
$$

Proportional changes in Demand for a good as the price for another good changes.

eg. Pepsi/Coke

$$
\frac{\%\Delta Q_\text{Pepsi}^D}{\%\Delta P_\text{Coke}}
=\frac{+5\%}{+10\%}
$$

- CPED will be positive for substitutes
- CPED will be negative for complements

## Income Elasticity of Demand
$$
\frac{\%\Delta Q_1^D}{\%\Delta Y}
$$
Resemblant of Normal/Inferior goods. In fact,
- Income Elasticity of Demand will be positive for normal goods
	- (increase in income causes an increase in demand)
- Income Elasticity of Demand will be negative for inferior goods
	- (decrease in income causes an increase in demand)

Goods that are "income elastic" (YED > 1), ie. spending rises faster than income, are known as "luxuries"
Goods that are "income inelastic" (0 < YED < 1), ie. spending rises slower than income, are "necessities"

## Demand Elasticity and Time
- Short v Long Run elasticity for e.g. gasoline
	- If gasoline prices rise dramatically, it might take a while for consumers to adjust their lifestyle. They won't find a closer job or move houses for a while.
- Short run and long run elasticity can change with time ![[IMG_8948.jpg]]

## Measuring Benefit to Consumers: Consumer Surplus
- Can we quantify the benefit of market transactions to consumers?
- Consumer surplus is defined as Consumers' willingness to pay for a unit less price paid.

## Social Surplus
- Social surplus is the sum of Consumer and Producer Surplus
	- This tells us (in dollar terms) what are the gains from trade

## Taxation
- Governments can't function without tax revenue
- Consider an "Excise Tax"
	- A tax on the purchase of a particular good or service.
		- e.g. Gasoline is subject to a 18.4 cent excise tax per gallon
- We say "the imposition of the tax is on the buyer" when the buyer must hand over the money to a government.
- Suppose before the imposition of a tax, the price of soda was $p$.
	- Then, the govt. levies a per unit tax of $t$.
	- Will the new price ($p'$) be:
		- $p' > p^*+t$
		- $p'=p^*+t$
		- $p^*+t>p'>p^*$
		- $p'=p^*$
		- $p'>p^*$
