## Recap
- Econ is concerned with the study of how scarce resources are allocated
- Scarcity implies opportunity cost

## What is a market?
- A market is a group of buyers and sellers who trade a particular good or service.
- Labor market: the buyers are companies, the sellers are employees (selling their labor).

## Demand
- A demand curve shows how much of a good or service would be purchased at each price
- The Law of Demand says as price increases, quantity demanded decreases.
- When prices increase, because income/wealth is finite, there is an:
	- Income effect $\to$ can't afford all previous consumption
	- Substitution effect $\to$ Other goods are relatively more attractive
- D might be a straight line. It could also be a curve.

## Demand and Inverse Demand
If the Demand Curve is:
$$
Q=a-bP
$$
And we re-arrange, we get the Inverse Demand Curve
$$
P = \frac{a}{b}-\frac{1}{b}Q
$$
## Demand and Marginal Willingness to Pay
- Marginal = "Extra" or "Additional" or "Next"
- The concept of marginal is central in economics
- Suppose you are consuming $n$ units of a particular product at price $p_1$.
	- So $(p, q) = (p_1, n)$ is a point on your demand curve
- What price would it have to be to consume $n+1$?
	- The answer $p_2$ is called your Marginal Willingness to pay for the $n+1\text{th}$ unit.
	- And $(p, q) = (p_2, n+1)$ is another point on the $D$ curve.
- The Paradox of Value $$Demand = \text{Marginal Willingness to Pay}$$
- Diamonds cost vastly more than water. That's because water is not (here and now) scarce! Therefore, our marginal willingness to pay is low. Think of a scenario where this would not be true.
- The notion of "at the margin" is fundamental in economics

## The Demand for Vacations
### Petroleum
Price increased but so did demand.
- The Demand Curve holds all else equal where else refers to price.

## Movement vs Shift in Demand
- The concept of _ceteris paribus_ allows us to distinguish between
	- A **movement** along the demand curve
		- Price changes, keeping everything else constant
	- A **shift** in the demand curve
		- Occurs when something other than price changes

What could cause a shift in Demand Curve?

Income
- Normal Good
- Inferior Good
- Substitutes
- Complements


## Discussion Section #1
a.)
$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
Q&=20-2P \\
P&=10-1/2Q
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

d.) If the price of burgers falls, we can assume that the price of pizza might also fall because these goods are substitutes, ie. serve the same purpose. The price of burgers will act as a ceiling to resist upward price movements of pizza.

Q4

a) If the population consuming electricity increases, the demand curve for electricity will shift to the right (more consumers)
b) If the cost of fuel used to generate electricity increases, the supply curve for electricity will shift to the left (offset higher costs)
c) If the price of home solar cells decreases, the demand curve for electricity will shift to the left (solar cells are a substitute for electricity)
d) demand increases
e) supply increases
